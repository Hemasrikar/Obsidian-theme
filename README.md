# Obsidian-theme

This is a custom theme made to my liking based on [Neutral Academia Theme](https://github.com/incantatem2/Obsidian-neutral-academia)

This is my primary theme for my academic valut. I will add features or adjust the theme as I go. If you want to use this theme, just download theme.css file and mainfest.json file, place them in a folder and place that folder in the obsidian theme folder.
